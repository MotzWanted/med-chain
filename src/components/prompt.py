        "question": "A 42-year-old man comes to the office for preoperative evaluation prior to undergoing adrenalectomy scheduled in 2 weeks. One month ago, he received care in the emergency department for pain over his right flank following a motor vehicle collision. At that time, blood pressure was 160/100 mm Hg and CT scan of the abdomen showed an incidental 10-cm left adrenal mass. Results of laboratory studies, including complete blood count, serum electrolyte concentrations, and liver function tests, were within the reference ranges. The patient otherwise had been healthy and had never been told that he had elevated blood pressure. He takes no medications. A follow-up visit in the office 2 weeks ago disclosed elevated urinary normetanephrine and metanephrine and plasma aldosterone concentrations. The patient was referred to a surgeon, who recommended the adrenalectomy. Today, vital signs are temperature 36.6째C (97.9째F), pulse 100/min, respirations 14/min, and blood pressure 170/95 mm Hg. Physical examination discloses no significant findings. Initial preoperative preparation should include treatment with which of the following?",

        "explanation": "Spuriously high blood pressure readings can be observed in various conditions. These include the auscultatory gap, which is a brief silence heard during measurement due to the disappearance of Korotkoff sounds, often found in hypertensive patients. Additionally, using a small cuff that is not appropriately sized for the patient can lead to falsely elevated readings. Obese individuals may also falsely experience high blood pressure due to the thick layer of fat that can dissipate cuff pressure, resulting in inaccurate readings. Lastly, patients with thick and calcified vessels may experience falsely high blood pressure readings.",
